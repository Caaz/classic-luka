##What is Luka?
An IRC bot written in Perl, very original idea.

It features a modular "plugins" system allowing for infinite yet diverse functionality based on usage scenario backed by a supportive framework.

This is a really old project and I don't like it so let's not talk about it. I'm throwing it here because I don't want to keep it locally anymore.
